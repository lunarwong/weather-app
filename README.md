# Weather App Project 
Live Demo of my [weather app](https://lunarwong.github.io/weather-app/) 

This is a personal project for practicing front-end development, with a focus on fetching API data from OpenWeather.

### Tech used:
JavaScript, CSS, React

### Features:
- Search for a city to show current weather information, along with the weather forecast for 5 days.
- Background changes based on the time of day.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

### Note from developer
The goal of this project was to apply my prior knowledge while minimize copying code from tutorial vdo as much as I can! 

For learning API fetch and writing asynchronous JavaScript, with guidance from [The Odin Project's asynchronouse and API lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript#asynchronous-javascript-and-apis) and [freeCodeCamp's youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reny0cTTv24). 

I also practiced implementing responsive design principles to design and create UI that adapt to different screen sizes.

Along with practice using git: creating branched, merging, adding commits, and pusing to GitHub!
